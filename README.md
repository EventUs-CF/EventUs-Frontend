## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application is designed to be a social media oriented around Events. The concept is that as a user you can sign-up in order to create, view and attend (running and drinking) events that are near the user. 

The original customer is for a local Hashing club to alleviate the need to post in multiple social media platforms, provide a streamlined UI for events in the area near the user and persist the organized data in an efficient manner. 

The application utilizes a MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React/Redux and Node.js) with OAuthorization to accomplish this.
